# Learning-Verilog
All of the Verilog solution files I have written for the HDLBits problems in order to teach myself Verilog.

## Structure
Closely follows the problems on [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page).
So, folder structure matches the hierarchy of the problems on the website. Not all problems are included here, only most important ones.

## Goal
I plan to use this website to learn Verilog. After completing all of the problems, I plan to then move on to learn SystemVerilog. From there, I plan to embark on a personal project of making my own RISC-V Core (or something similar).
