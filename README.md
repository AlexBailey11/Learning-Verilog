# Learning-Verilog
All of the Verilog solution files I have written for the [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) problems in order to teach myself Verilog.

## Structure
Closely follows the problems on [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page).
So, folder structure matches the hierarchy of the problems on the website. Not all problems are included here, only most important ones.

## Goal
I plan to follow the HDLBits problems to learn Verilog. After completing them, I plan to move on to learn SystemVerilog.
Once I am comfortable with SV, I plan to implement my own RISC-V Core.
A separate repo will be made for the RISC-V Core once I start the project.
